            <li>
              Step 1 is to pick (3) numbers from 0–9. For example 5,3,6 would be your first picked random numbers from given 0–9. To add more thrill and substance to the diversion, the numbers are then included/added (5 + 3 + 6) and a last number is given. In this example it is 14. Now, you only have have to keep one digit of this number, that is the last one. In this example, it will be the 4. So your first draw would be 5,3,6 *4.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are also a second set of numbers which is drawn. The process is similar just like step 1. The rules for picking 2nd number is exactly same as the first draw. As an random case, lets accept the numbers 8,2,8. This gives us a sum of 18, we again just only keep the last digit so our last pick for the second draw of numbers is 8,2,8 *8
            </li>
            <li>
              Our last card would resemble this: 5,3,6 *4 X 8,2,8 *8. Here is an example card.

          Satta is not currently legal in India, but it is still big business. Lotteries have become more attractive online because they combine all lotteries on an international level, so those from India can leverage their bets by only picking lottery cards where the jackpot is the biggest. India has a relatively small lottery jackpot while the US and EU countries have jackpots commonly in the 100's of millions of Euros/USD. For other betting games, a large majority of Indians are still betting with local bookies, but more are using the internet at online casinos and online bookies like Betway for cricket and other sports or casino games.

      title: "How Do You Win At Matka?",
      content: "To win at Matka Satta, you have various rate payouts, ranging from 9/1 to 999/1. You can bet on the chance of all numbers coming up to the first, last, or any other type of bet allowed by the Matka gambling bookie. For this reason, it can be an attractive game because of the payout multiples, but the game is merely a game of chance and therefore can not be beaten. It requires luck to win, but many are superstitious about their numbers and always play them, just like the lottery games."

        <>
          The Satta betting agent should only take a maximum of 5% of your wager amount assuming you win. Because the game is all luck and neither the agent nor the bettor has an advantage, the bookie should take home 5% on every Rupee wagered. Heavy betting on a certain number or combination of numbers can be a dangerous scenario. If those numbers come up, it is very likely your bookie will vanish because he can't afford to cover the wagers. When the cards and numbers are picked, generally at 9 PM and 12 at night the winners are declared. This is how a payout would occur.
          <br /><br />Example Of A 10 Rupees Bet:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>You choose the correct first number drawn: 9 X Your Wager of 10Rs = 90 Rs.</li>
            <li>Your second number is drawn: 9 X Your Wager of 10Rs = 90 Rs.</li>
            <li>You choose the middle number (the jodi) and the first number correct in combination: 90 X Your Wager = 900 Rs.</li>
          </ul>

      content: "The origins of Indian Matka gambling involve wagering on the daily price of cotton according to the Bombay and the New York Cotton Exchange. Nowadays, Matka betting, or Satta King, is a popular lottery-style game. It involves the selection of random numbers in the hopes of hitting the right number combination. The winner becomes the Satta King and they earn the bulk of the prize pool. The legendary Ratan Khatri is popularly known as the Matka King. After his arrest in 1995, he had to discontinue his games and now crooks are running the game he loved so much by fixing the numbers. A big fall from grace, but his name remains legendary among Satta Matka games in Mumbai."

IPL betting draws people like nothing else in India and fans wait eagerly to place bets on the event."
